In this course, there's both a practical component, using Scratch in the lab,
and a "big ideas" component, in lecture and discussion.  One of the things we
want you to take away from this course is to know that there's more to
computer science than just writing computer programs, although of course we
use those other things to help in writing programs.  So we'll talk about some
aspects of the social context of computing, some of the theoretical
explorations of the limits of computation, and some important moments in
the history of computer science -- for example, you'll learn in a few weeks
how one of the first computer scientists more or less singlehandedly won
World War II for the good guys.

I'm in two places at once, sorry.

This week's big idea:  Abstraction.  Arguably the central idea of all of
computer science.  As I say in 61A, computer programming is easy, as long
as the programs are small.  What's hard isn't the programming, but the
keeping track of details in a huge program.  The solution is chunking, or
layering -- two metaphors for abstraction.

The classic example is thinking about a car.  Cars are made of nuts, bolts,
metal rods, big metal blocks, rubber or paper gaskets, plastic containers
for fluids, rivets, wires, and so on.  (Each piece of metal is further made
of atoms, which are made of electrons, protons, and neutrons, which are made
of quarks, and so on down.)  But if you're trying to repair a car, you don't
think in those terms; if you did, you'd never find where the problem is.
Instead you think about the engine, the alternator, the fuel injectors,
the brakes, the transmission, and so on.  That's abstraction.

The march of technological progress is, at least in part, a march toward
greater and greater abstraction.  Each step reduces the extent to which
people have to think about details.  Sticking with cars as the example, in
the early days, every driver had to be at least something of a mechanic,
knowing how to deal with the rather frequent failures of the machinery.
Before automatic transmissions. only people with some understanding of gear
ratios could drive.  (In the really early days, they couldn't downshift
without mastering the skill of double-clutching.)

The automatic transmission made possible an enormous abstraction.  All the
complexity of the machinery that makes a car work was hidden under the
surface of a very simple model:  You push the pedal on the right and the
car speeds up; you push the pedal on the left and it slows down.  Suddenly
just about anyone could drive a car.

Of course, the widespread use of cars has turned out to be a mixed blessing.
Cars are one of the main causes of pollution and global warming.  Computers,
too, have their downsides, which we'll be discussing later.  Many historians
of science stay away from the word "progress," which I used two paragraphs
back, because of its implicit suggestion that the development of new
technology is always good.  But before we can criticize technology we should
understand something about how it works, and abstraction is a very powerful
organizing idea to describe the mechanism.

Those two pedals, the gas pedal and the brake, are an /interface/, also known
as an abstraction barrier.  On the driver's side of the abstraction, what
matters is the /behavior/ provided by this interface.  Push this one to
speed up, that one to slow down.  Once that interface became standardized,
further technical development has dramatically changed what happens up in
the engine compartment.  Originally, the gas pedal mechanically pushed a
lever controlling a valve that determined the rate at which gasoline could
flow into the engine.  More gasoline, bigger explosions inside the engine,
more power, so more speed.  Today, the gas pedal doesn't really do anything
mechanically, except provide an input to a computer inside the car, whose
job is to control the fuel injection system.  Your input is combined with
other information about the car's environment to operate smaller valves,
one per cylinder, that control the gas/air mixture more precisely.

The brake pedal has had a similar history.  Originally, your foot directly
provided the power to push the brake pads against the wheels.  Then a new
mechanism was developed, preserving the interface -- push here to slow down --
but now using the pressure from your foot to operate a hydraulic system that
does the hard work of pressing the pads against the wheels.  But there was
one important difference.  The first "power brakes," like the modern gas
pedal, completely eliminated the mechanical linkage between the pedal and
the actual brakes.  But after a few accidents in which people couldn't stop
their cars because the engine died, this design was modified.  Today you
have "power assisted brakes," which means that your foot both operates a
hydraulic cylinder and /also/ directly puts pressure on the brakes.  If the
engine fails, you have to push a lot harder to stop the car, but at least
it's possible.  The latest development, anti-lock brakes, actually lets a
computer in the car override your pressure on the brake pedal if you are in
danger of putting the car into a skid by trying to stop too abruptly.

But the point is that drivers who aren't particularly interested in cars
don't have to know any of this.  All they have to know is that you push the
pedal on the right to speed up, and the one on the left to slow down!
This /interface/ has survived through several generations of underlying
technology, because it's a good interface -- simple but expressive.
Car engineers could have made each generation of new technology more visible
to drivers, with lots of knobs and switches and readouts, but they wisely
refrained, and stayed with the abstraction -- the interface -- developed
a century ago.

How does abstraction work in computer programming?  We'll be revisiting this
question all semester.  But, for a starting point, think about the blocks in
the Scratch menu.  Each block names a simple intention, comparable to "speed
up" or "slow down" in a car.  But the mechanisms that make those blocks do
their job are actually doing very complicated detail work.  For example,
"move 10 steps," above the abstraction barrier, just tells Scratch to move
over a little.  But Scratch isn't a real cat; it's a collection of colored
dots drawn on a computer screen.  "Move 10 steps" really means to erase each
of those dots, then redraw them all in a different position.  And the "glide"
block is even more complicated; it has to erase and redraw Scratch many times,
moving just a tiny bit each time.

But if the abstraction is working well, you're not thinking about tiny dots
of light at all, while working with Scratch.  You're moving a /cat/!

We're using an experimental version of Scratch, called BYOB, for "build your
own block," which lets you, the Scratch user, build your own abstractions.
You can take a complicated sequence of actions, wrap them up, and present
them to another user -- or to yourself thinking at a higher level of
abstraction -- as a new interface, allowing you to command a new behavior
without having to know anything about the detailed implementation.
