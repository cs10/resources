            <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black"><font size="2"><br>
            Psychologist Kevin Durkin, who reviewed the research on violent 
            video games in 1995, reported that studies had found &quot;either no or 
            minimal effects.&quot; Indeed, he added: &quot;some very tentative evidence 
            indicates that aggressive game play may be cathartic (promote the 
            release of aggressive tensions) for some individuals.&quot; Durkin 
            reported in a 1999 follow-up survey that &quot;early fears of pervasively 
            negative effects&quot; from video games &quot;are not supported&quot;; &quot;several 
            well designed studies conducted by proponents of the theory that 
            computer games would promote aggression in the young have found no 
            such effects&quot; [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#4" name="4">4</a>]. 
            His findings were echoed by other scholars [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#5" name="5">5</a>].</font></span></font></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">One 
            proponent of the causal hypothesis, however, continued to search for 
            evidence of harmful effects. In 2000, Craig Anderson and a colleague 
            reported on a lab experiment and a correlational study they had 
            conducted [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#6" name="6">6</a>]. 
            In the experiment, they had college students play part of either a 
            violent or a non-violent video game, then tested them for aggression 
            or &quot;aggressive cognition&quot; by asking them to give &quot;noise blasts&quot; to a 
            game opponents or recognize &quot;aggressive words&quot; on a computer screen. 
            A somewhat larger number of the subjects who played the violent game 
            excerpt gave slightly longer noise blasts or recognized the words 
            slightly more quickly. The differences were in fractions of seconds. 
            In addition, it was highly questionable whether word recognition or 
            noise blasts demonstrated anything realistic about actual intent to 
            harm another person [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#7" name="7">7</a>]. 
            Nevertheless, Anderson concluded that exposure to &quot;a graphically 
            violent video game increased aggressive thoughts and behavior&quot; [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#8" name="8">8</a>].</font></span></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black"><font size="2">In 
            the same article, Anderson reviewed previous video game research. Of 
            four experiments that found &quot;weak&quot; support for the causal 
            hypothesis, he acknowledged that none had ruled out &quot;the possibility 
            that key variables such as excitement, difficulty, or enjoyment 
            created the observed increase in aggression.&quot; Other experiments were 
            negative or yielded &quot;mixed results&quot; and &quot;little evidence&quot; of adverse 
            effect. Yet the following year, Anderson and a colleague reported on 
            a new &quot;meta-analysis&quot; that they conducted, averaging the results of 
            33 separate studies on violent video games. Now, they concluded that 
            the studies showed violent games &quot;increase aggressive behavior in 
            children and young adults&quot; [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#9" name="9">9</a>].</font></span></font></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">Scholars 
            critiqued Anderson's new calculations as well as his interpretation 
            of the underlying studies [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#10" name="10">10</a>]. 
            As they pointed out, if experiments with dubious results are 
            incorrectly interpreted as supportive of the causal hypothesis, the 
            resulting meta-analysis will only magnify the error. </font></span>

            <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black"><font size="2">In 
            2000, Indianapolis passed an ordinance restricting minors' access to 
            violent video games in arcades. The city relied on Anderson's 
            &quot;aggressive word&quot;/noise blast experiment to assert that a causal 
            connection had been established between violent games and aggressive 
            behavior. The Court of Appeals stuck down the ordinance, ruling that 
            Anderson did not show that &quot;video games have ever caused anyone to 
            commit a violent act,&quot; or &quot;have caused the average level of violence 
            to increase anywhere.&quot; The court noted that violent themes have 
            always been part of children's literature; to shield youngsters from 
            the subject &quot;would not only be quixotic, but deforming&quot; [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#11" name="11">11</a>].</font></span></font></p>

            Fantasy violence has been a theme in art, literature, and 
            entertainment since the beginning of civilization, but attempts to 
            prove through science that it has adverse effects are less than a 
            century old. In 1928, the Payne Fund commissioned sociologists to 
            gather data on the effects of cinema violence through surveys and 
            interviews. The process took four years, and resulted in multiple 
            published volumes. The conclusions were guarded and equivocal, but 
            caution was forgotten in a one-volume summary, <i>Our Movie Made 
            Children, </i>which became a best-seller and claimed the studies had 
            proved harmful effects [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#12" name="12">12</a>].</font></span></font></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black"><font size="2">In 
            the 1950s, psychiatrist Fredric Wertham asserted that his informal 
            research with juvenile delinquents proved violent comic books to 
            cause crime. Wertham's methods were anecdotal; he had no control 
            groups; and he mistakenly relied on correlations as proof of 
            causation. But his assertions resonated with a public eager for 
            answers to concerns about crime [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#13" name="13">13</a>].</font></span></font></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">The next 
            subject of study was television. Soon after TV's emergence, 
            politicians began to stoke public anxieties about violent content. 
            At the same time, a new field of psychology, social learning theory, 
            posited that children imitate media violence. These psychologists 
            believed, moreover, that such effects could be measured through 
            laboratory experiments. Albert Bandura, leader of the social 
            learning school, conducted experiments demonstrating that some 
            children shown films of adults hitting Bobo dolls will imitate the 
            behavior immediately afterward [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#14" name="14">14</a>]. 
            Even though Bobo dolls are meant to be hit, and aggressive play is 
            far different from real-world intent to harm, Bandura announced that 
            he had proved adverse effects from media violence. The announcement 
            resonated politically, and the federal government was soon funding 
            other studies. </font></span></p>

            <font size="2" face="Arial">The first major result of this funding 
            was a 1972 Surgeon General's report that noted a &quot;preliminary and 
            tentative indication&quot; of a causal link between TV violence and 
            real-world behavior, but cautioned that this possible effect was 
            &quot;small,&quot; and only in children already predisposed to aggression 
            [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#15" name="15">15</a>]. 
            As historian Willard Rowland recounts, however, legislators 
            misrepresented the report's cautious conclusions, claiming that a 
            definitive link had been proven [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#16" name="16">16</a>].</font></span></p>

            Psychologist Jonathan Freedman, who began studying media-effects 
            research in the early 1980s, was astounded at the disparity between 
            the claims being made and the actual results. In a 1984 article, he 
            reported that although there is a small statistical correlation 
            between preference for TV violence and aggressive behavior, there is 
            no evidence of a causal link. Likewise, he said, laboratory 
            experiments, which can show a short-term imitation effect, are too 
            artificial to offer much guidance on TV's real-world impact. And 
            field experiments, more realistic attempts to gauge media-violence 
            influence, had wholly inconclusive results [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#17" name="17">17</a>].</font></span></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black"><font size="2">
            Freedman found many instances of researchers manipulating results to 
            bolster their theories. A field experiment in 1973, for example, 
            widely cited in support the causal hypothesis, had numerous measures 
            of aggression, all of which failed to produce any finding of adverse 
            effects. Not satisfied, the researchers divided the children into 
            &quot;initially high aggression&quot; and &quot;initially low aggression&quot; 
            categories, and again compared results. Still there were no 
            indications of harm from viewing violent programs (&quot;Batman&quot; and 
            &quot;Superman&quot;). The initially high-aggression group, for example, 
            became somewhat less aggressive after the experiment, no matter 
            which programs they watched. But after more number-crunching, the 
            researchers found that the initially high-aggression children who 
            were shown violent programs &quot;decreased less in aggressiveness&quot; than 
            the initially high-aggression children who watched neutral programs. 
            They seized upon this one finding to claim they had found support 
            for the causal hypothesis [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#18" name="18">18</a>].</font></span></font></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">Probably 
            the most widely cited research project in these years was a 
            &quot;longitudinal&quot; study – tracking correlations over time – to 
            determine whether early preferences for violent entertainment 
            correlate with aggressiveness later in life. The researchers found 
            no correlation between violent TV viewing at age 8 and aggressive 
            behavior at age 18 for two out of three measures of aggression. But 
            there was a correlation for boys on a third measure of aggression – 
            peer reports. They seized upon this finding, and claimed proof of 
            harm from TV violence [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#19" name="19">19</a>].</font></span></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black"><font size="2">They 
            also later claimed a correlation between violent TV viewing in 
            childhood and violent crime at age 30. Oddly, however, they did not 
            disclose the actual numbers of violent criminals on whom they based 
            their conclusions, and their published report did not mention a link 
            between early violent viewing and adult crime at all. Nevertheless, 
            one of the researchers, Rowell Huesmann, testified in 1986 before 
            the U.S. Senate using a bar graph purportedly showing how violent TV 
            causes violent crime. When, years later, author Richard Rhodes asked 
            for the actual numbers, Huesmann acknowledged that the correlation 
            shown in his dramatic bar graph was based on just three individuals 
            who committed violent crimes [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#20" name="20">20</a>].</font></span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black">
            <font size="2">Huesmann went on to write a pivotal article on media 
            violence in the next major government report, released in 1982 [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#21" name="21">21</a>]. 
            It was an opportunity, as Rowland observes, to &quot;provide a resurgent 
            call to arms&quot; by those &quot;disappointed in the cautious tone&quot; of the 
            1972 report [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#22" name="22">22</a>]. 
            But many scholars disputed its claim that harmful effects had been 
            proven [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#23" name="23">23</a>]. 
            Yale professor William McGuire, for example, wrote that despite the 
            hype, two decades of media-effects research had found little or no 
            real-world behavioral impact from violent entertainment [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#24" name="24">24</a>].</font></span></font></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black"><font size="2">Other 
            researchers used correlation studies rather than experiments to test 
            the causal hypothesis. One much-publicized study of this type found 
            a correlation between the introduction of television in three 
            countries and subsequent homicide rates. Without considering either 
            the level of violent content in early TV, or other, more likely, 
            explanations for the increased homicides, the researcher announced 
            that &quot;the introduction of television in the 1950s caused a 
            subsequent doubling of the homicide rate&quot; [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#25" name="25">25</a>]. 
            Many scholars disputed his claims, most notably two criminologists 
            who reported in 1996 that homicide rates in many countries including 
            the U.S. had decreased over the previous two decades despite 
            increases in media violence [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#26" name="26">26</a>].</font></span></font></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><font size="2" face="Arial"><span style="color:black">Some 
            correlation research flatly undermined the causal hypothesis. In 
            1986, for example, Steven Messner reported negative correlations 
            between exposure to violent TV and violent crime in 281 metropolitan 
            areas. Messner stated: &quot;The data consistently indicate that high 
            levels of exposure to violent television content are accompanied by 
            relatively low rates of violent crime&quot; [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#27" name="27">27</a>] </span>

            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">Similarly, 
            an ambitious cross-national study coordinated by Huesmann and his 
            colleague Leonard Eron found no significant correlations over time 
            between children's media violence viewing and aggressive behavior in 
            Australia, Finland, the Netherlands, Poland, the U.S., or Kibbutz 
            children in Israel. The only strong correlations were for two groups 
            of Israeli city dwellers. Yet in this case, as Freedman recounts, 
            most of the researchers &quot;tried to put the best face on it that they 
            could&quot; in the book that resulted. &quot;They hedged, did other analyses, 
            and tried to make it sound as if the results supported the initial 
            prediction that television violence would increase aggression.&quot; The 
            Dutch researchers, however, did not hedge. &quot;Their write-up came 
            right out and said that there was no evidence of any effect.&quot; 
            Huesmann and Eron refused to publish their chapter unless they

            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">Some 
            experiments, meanwhile, found more aggressive behavior associated

            Neighborhood.&quot; Joyce Sprafkin, who conducted some of these studies, 
            later described her reaction: &quot;I decided to look back carefully at 
            the field and say, well, what have other people really found?&quot; For 
            pre-school children, the field studies simply &quot;did not support a

            <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black"><font size="2">This 
            year, Jonathan Freedman published a thorough review of some 200 
            experiments or studies – all that he could locate – attempting to 
            test the causal hypothesis. He found that most had negative results, 
            even accepting as positive some experiments that used poor, almost 
            ridiculous, proxies for aggression. Of 87 lab experiments, 37% 
            supported the causal hypothesis; 22% had mixed results, and 41% were 
            non-supportive. After Freedman factored out experiments using &quot;the 
            most doubtful measures of aggression,&quot; only 28% of the results were 
            supportive, 16% were mixed, and 55% were non-supportive of the

            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">Freedman 
            was hardly alone. A 2000 review of media-violence research by the 
            Federal Trade Commission reported that no firm conclusions about 
            adverse effects can be drawn [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#31" name="31">31</a>].</font></span></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">In 1994, a 
            federal court in New York heard expert testimony on media-effects 
            research. The case involved a county ordinance that barred 
            dissemination to minors of any &quot;trading card&quot; that depicts a 
            &quot;heinous crime&quot; or a &quot;heinous criminal,&quot; and is &quot;harmful to minors.&quot; 
            Expert testimony from Jonathan Freedman and Joyce Sprafkin made 
            clear that, contrary to popular belief, research on the effects of 
            media violence has yielded inconclusive results. The court held that 
            the county had not justified the ordinance with any evidence of harm

            results do not establish real-world harm</font></b></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">Despite the 
            overall failure of media-effects researchers to prove harmful 
            effects, some studies have reported positive findings. There are a 
            number of reasons why these occasional positive results do not 
            support the hypothesis that fantasy violence has adverse real-world 
            effects.</font></span></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">The first 
            reason relates to a fundamental but often-forgotten fact about 
            social science research. Its results are &quot;probabilistic.&quot; That is, 
            the &quot;identification of a causal relationship&quot; through lab or field 
            experiments &quot;does not entail the conclusion that the identified 
            cause produces the effect in all, a majority, or even a very large 
            proportion of cases&quot; [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#33" name="33">33</a>]. 
            Thus, even studies that show a &quot;statistically significant&quot; link 
            between violent entertainment and aggressive behavior do not mean 
            that the link exists for most, or even a substantial minority of, 
            individuals. &quot;Significant&quot; in the statistical sense &quot;does not mean 
            ‘important.' It means simply ‘not likely to happen just by chance'&quot; 
            [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#34" name="34">34</a>].</font></span></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">Another 
            problem with drawing real-world conclusions from quantitative 
            media-effects research is that both &quot;violence&quot; and &quot;aggression&quot; are 
            very broad concepts. Researchers have used vastly different examples 
            of violent content in the cartoons, film clips, or games that they 
            study. Generalizations about all violence (or all &quot;graphic 
            violence&quot;) from these differing examples are not trustworthy, and 
            fail to account for the many different contexts in which works of 
            art or entertainment present violence.</font></span></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black"><font size="2">Yet 
            another problem is that experimenters have not always made their 
            non-violent excerpts equivalent to their violent ones in respect to 
            other variables such as general level of interest or excitement. 
            Freedman gives a striking example – an early, much-cited experiment 
            that compared subjects' behavior after watching either an exciting 
            film clip of a prizefight or a soporific clip about canal boats. 
            Since the canal boat film was not nearly as exciting as the 
            prizefight film, it was probably the subjects' general arousal 
            level, not their imitation of violence onscreen, that accounted for 
            a statistical difference in their subsequent lab behavior [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#35" name="35">35</a>].</font></span></font></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">Measuring 
            &quot;aggression&quot; is a further problem. For one thing, not all aggression 
            is socially disapproved. For another, aggressive attitudes or 
            &quot;cognition&quot; are not the same as aggressive behavior. Proxies for 
            aggression in lab experiments range from dubious (noise blasts; Bobo 
            dolls; &quot;killing&quot; characters in a video game) to ludicrous (popping 
            balloons; interpreting ambiguous stories in a way that coders 
            consider &quot;more hostile&quot;; recommending a grant termination) 
            [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#36" name="36">36</a>].</font></span></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">Moreover, 
            aggressive play, whether in a lab or in the real world, is far 
            different from real aggression intended to hurt another person [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#37" name="37">37</a>]. 
            Indeed, aggressive play provides a socially approved outlet for 
            impulses that otherwise might take dangerous forms. Thus, the 
            argument that the statistical link between media violence and 
            aggression is as strong as the link between cigarette smoking and 
            cancer (or other physiological analogues that are often used), even 
            if it were true empirically, would be meaningless, because while 
            scientists can measure the presence or absence of disease, 
            psychologists cannot measure real aggression through the proxies 
            used in lab experiments.</font></span></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">A final 
            problem is the &quot;experimenter demand&quot; factor. Not only are behaviors 
            permitted and encouraged in experiments that would be disapproved 
            outside the lab, but subjects generally know what the researcher is 
            looking for. Numerous scholars have noted this problem [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#38" name="38">38</a>].

            They look, as Professor David Buckingham puts it, at &quot;the diverse 
            and active ways in which children and young people use the media for 
            different social and psychological purposes&quot; [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#40" name="40">40</a>]. 
            MIT's Henry Jenkins summed up this approach when he wrote that many 
            young people &quot;move nomadically across the media landscape, cobbling 
            together a personal mythology of symbols and stories, and investing 
            those appropriated materials with various personal and subcultural 
            meanings.&quot; Because of this wide variety of responses, 
            &quot;universalizing claims are fundamentally inadequate in accounting 
            for media's social and cultural impact&quot; [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#41" name="41">41</a>]. 
            The National Academy of Sciences has likewise pointed out that the 
            causal hypothesis is simplistic because it fails to consider either 
            how different individuals respond to identical stimuli, or how 
            different individuals' psychosocial, neurological, and hormonal 
            characteristics interact to produce behavior [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#42" name="42">42</a>].

            entertainment influence different individuals in varying ways, 
            depending upon their characters, intelligence, upbringing, and 
            social situation. For a relatively few predisposed youths, the modus 
            operandi of a crime depicted in a film might inspire them to 
            incorporate those details into a violent act [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#43" name="43">43</a>]. 
            For a far greater number, the same violent work will be relaxing,

            describes at least four functions of violent entertainment: offering 
            youngsters &quot;fantasies of empowerment,&quot; &quot;fantasies of transgression,&quot; 
            &quot;intensification of emotional experience,&quot; and &quot;an acknowledgment

            Similarly, psychologist Jeffrey Arnett, studying a correlation 
            between adolescents' reckless behavior and preference for violent 
            music, found &quot;sensation seeking&quot; to be the independent factor that 
            accounts for both the preference and the behavior. He reported that 
            &quot;adolescents who like heavy metal music listen to it especially when 
            they are angry and that the music has the effect of calming them 
            down and dissipating their anger&quot; [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#45" name="45">45</a>].

            childhood and adolescence have long recognized the importance of 
            violent fantasy play in overcoming anxieties, processing anger, and 
            providing outlets for aggression. Bruno Bettelheim was a pioneer in 
            describing these responses in the context of violent fairy tales [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#46" name="46">46</a>]. 
            As film historian Jon Lewis explains, Bettelheim understood that 
            children have &quot;terrible struggles, terrible fears&quot;; they are &quot;small, 
            and fully aware that they have no power.&quot; Violent stories &quot;offer a 
            safe opportunity to fantasize about having some power in a world

            Contributors to the anthology <i>Why We Watch </i>report that some

            Gerard Jones recently interviewed psychiatrists, pediatricians, 
            therapists, teachers, and parents on the attractions of fantasy 
            violence. &quot;I gathered hundreds of stories of young people who had 
            benefitted from superhero comics, action movies, cartoons, shoot-'em-up 
            video games, and angry rap and rock songs,&quot; he writes. For the most 
            part, he found young people &quot;using fantasies of combat in order to 
            feel stronger, to access their emotions, to take control of their 
            anxieties, [and] to calm themselves down in the face of real 
            danger.&quot; Jones notes that one function of play is to explore, &quot;in a

            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">The most 
            peaceful, empathetic, conscientious children are often excited by 
            the most aggressive entertainment. Young people who reject violence, 
            guns, and bigotry in every form can sift through the literal 
            contents of a movie, game, or song and still embrace the emotional 
            power at its heart. Children need to feel strong. They need to feel 
            powerful in the face of a scary, uncontrollable world. Superheroes, 
            video-game warriors, rappers, and movie gunmen are symbols of 
            strength [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#49" name="49">49</a>].

            <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black"><font size="2">These 
            attractions of fantasy violence are especially pertinent to video 
            games. In 1995, communications scholar Joel Saxe used in-depth 
            interviews &quot;to assess a full range of player preferences and 
            interpretations related to video games.&quot; He found that gamers 
            express a &quot;deep sense of thrill&quot; in response to the &quot;highly 
            exaggerated, on-screen violent fantasy play.&quot; Transgression, 
            rebellion, and the ability to defy the &quot;formal rules of civility&quot; in 
            a fantasy world all contributed to the appeal. &quot;As players elaborate 
            the meaning of the gaming experience,&quot; Saxe says, they interpret the 
            fantasy play as a &quot;healthy outlet,&quot; providing &quot;a means of releasing 
            feelings of aggression.&quot; The play &quot;is also linked to feelings of 
            positive accomplishment,&quot; given the competitive format of the games, 
            and the level of skill required [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#50" name="50">50</a>].</font></span></font></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black"><font size="2">
            Similarly, researchers in Denmark, using &quot;qualitative methods such 
            as in-depth interviews and observations,&quot; found &quot;competition, 
            challenge, and achievement&quot; to be particular attractions of video 
            games. &quot;The violent elements in computer games are attractive as 
            spectacular effects,&quot; and because &quot;they prompt excitement and 
            thrill.&quot; They are &quot;in line with genres known from the film 
            industry,&quot; such as action films and animation, and thus have 
            inherited violence from other media that emphasize spectacular 
            effects. The element of exaggeration &quot;is fully recognized by 
            children.&quot; In fact, children see the violence in video games as less 
            anxiety-provoking than movies and television, because it is more 
            clearly fantastic. The children in the investigation, some as young 
            as five, were fully aware of the difference between reality and the 
            exaggerated fiction of computer games [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#51" name="51">51</a>].</font></span></font></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Arial"><span style="color:black"><font size="2">Part 
            of video games' appeal is their communal character. Often they are 
            played in groups, and even when played alone, the iconography of the 
            games forms a bond among many youngsters. A number of authors have 
            described the elaborate communities associated with video games [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#52" name="52">52</a>]. 
            Saxe notes: &quot;even though the screen fantasy play revolves around 
            brute violence, the actual relations among players in the immediate 
            play area are cooperative, if not amiable&quot; [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#53" name="53">53</a>].</font></span></font></p>

            who rely on lab experiments or statistical correlations fail to take 
            account of this social context. As psychologist Jeffrey Goldstein 
            explains, young people bring their entertainment choices to bear on 
            &quot;questions of identity, belonging and independence.&quot; Their taste in 
            clothes, music, and video games &quot;has a social purpose.&quot; </font>

            researchers look, not at isolated individuals forced to play a video 
            game for a few minutes as part of a laboratory experiment, but at 
            game players as members of social groups, we are unlikely to come to 
            terms with violent, or any other, entertainment [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#54" name="54">54</a>].</font></span></font></p>

            Likewise, the Danish researchers found that &quot;children's fascination 
            with violent computer games cannot be understood without considering 
            these social aspects. The violent elements fascinate some children, 
            but this fascination should not be mistaken for a fascination with 
            violence in the real world. On the contrary, all children in the 
            investigation repudiated real-life violence&quot; [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#55" name="55">55</a>].</font></span></font></p>
            <p style="line-height: 150%"><span style="color:black"><font size="2" face="Arial">It is true,

            empowerment, excitement, feelings of competence, and membership in a 
            community. Jones observes: &quot;heavy gamers as a population are 
            overwhelmingly non-confrontational geeks&quot; [<a href="1_01_amici_part5.htm#56" name="56">56</a>].

            writes, &quot;is based on a profound misunderstanding about the social 
            and emotional function of games. Games allow people who are midway 
            between childhood and adulthood to engage in fantasies of power to 
            compensate for their own feelings of personal powerlessness. This
